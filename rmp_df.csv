You are allowed to use the book and your notes on all quizzes and tests.. come on now. As a non-economics major I found this class extremely easy. There are lots of assignments but they are so east. Seriously such an easy A. If you didn't pass you must not know how to read...",0,0,2020-12-12

A lot of the exams and quizzes were based off of learnsmart exercises online which were very easy to make mistakes on and drastically affected grading. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this class to non-economic majors.",0,0,2020-11-18

She's incredibly knowledgeable about the topic and displays a positive attitude the entire semester. Helps students achieve the best grade they can by answering all questions and opening a GroupMe for students. She's also super attractive which is a plus. Make sure to attend the class though because there are pop ups",0,0,2020-07-24

The quizzes and tests are relatively hard depending on how much effort you put in, of course, but they're weighted very little.
